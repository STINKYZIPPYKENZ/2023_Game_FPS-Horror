Instead, schedule the right number of jobs for the dispatch pair phases created by the scheduler to prevent scheduling and processing overheads. This leads to speed-ups in the time consumed by jobs in the `SolveAndIntegrateSystem` specifically in cases with low to medium joint and contact counts.\n* The `PhysicsColliderKeyEntityPair` buffer is now added only when needed and its internal capacity of the buffer is set to zero, ensuring its content always lives outside of the chunk. This way, we don't unnecessarily increase the rigid body sizes in chunks, allowing for a larger number of rigid bodies in a single chunk, which improves performance.\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Fixed regression in accessibility of `PhysicsShapeAuthoring` API. The functions `GetCapsuleProperties()` and `SetCapsule()` were made internal by accident during the move of the custom physics authoring components from the package API to a package sample and are now public again."

It is now no longer supported to add built-in colliders, such as the Box Collider, to a rigid body created using the `PhysicsBodyAuthoring` component. The inverse however, adding `PhysicsShapeAuthoring` components to a rigid body created using the built-in `Rigidbody` component, is still supported.\n* Updated Burst version to 1.8.4\n\n### Removed\n\n* UpgradePhysicsData window has been removed.\n* The custom Unity Physics authoring experience, built around the `PhysicsBodyAuthoring` and `PhysicsShapeAuthoring` components, has been removed from the package and turned into a package sample. It is recommended to use the built-in physics authoring components instead, e.g., the `Rigidbody` and collider components. To continue using the custom authoring experience in your projects, simply import the _Custom Physics Authoring_ sample from the Unity Physics package into your project via the Package Manager window.\n* Dependency on com.unity.test-framework\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Colliders created from PhysicsShapeAuthoring components with the \"Force Unique\" flag set to true now are ensured to have unique collider blobs that are not shared across rigid bodies when they have identical properties, thus enabling runtime modification of individual colliders."
